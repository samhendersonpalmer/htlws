'How to Lie with Statistics' was written in the 1950's by Darrell Huff - a journalist who later put it into action defending Big Tobacco at the height of all their dodginess. Although now outdated with some cringe moments, it was wildly popular and was essentially a masterclass in how to sell statistics to the masses.

I like to think highlighting how this stuff can be misused helps us spot those moments when it is - and at a time where we're awash with bullshit stats it feels more relevant than ever. 

> the crooks already know these tricks; honest men must learn them in self-defence.

As far as technical details, this quarto dashboard project was created by Sam Henderson-Palmer based on a tutorial by [Melissa Van Bussel](https://www.youtube.com/@ggnot2).
