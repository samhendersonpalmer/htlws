Although now outdated with some cringe moments, it was wildly popular and was essentially a masterclass in how to sell statistics to the masses.\nI like to think highlighting how this stuff can be misused helps us spot those moments when it is - and at a time when the world is awash with bullshit stats it feels more relevant than ever.\nAs far as technical details, this quarto dashboard project was created by Sam Henderson-Palmer based on a tutorial by Melissa Van Bussel.\n\n\n\n\nYou can buy the book here",
